  abstract = {A warming climate has driven rapid physical changes in the Arctic environment, particularly in the Bering Sea. Biological changes are also increasingly evident in the Bering Sea and adjacent waters. The ecological results have been profound and relatively well documented for fishes and lower trophic levels. Upper trophic predators such as marine mammals, however, have been underrepresented in ecosystem surveys, models, and efforts to practice ecosystem-based fisheries management. We used multiple linear regression to model body condition (mass/length) as a function of species, age class, sex and year for ribbon and spotted seals in the Bering Sea, and harbor seals in the Aleutian Islands, from 2007 to 2018, for evidence of recent trends that might reflect trophic or bottom-up changes in the ecosystem. Model-averaged coefficients (in kg cm−1, relative to the overall mean) indicated that body condition was lower for subadults (−0.063; 95% CI: −0.074 – −0.051) and pups (−0.120; 95% CI: −0.129 – −0.112) than for adults (0.183, the negative sum of the subadults and pups coefficients). Body condition for males (0.010; 95% CI: 0.002–0.019) was higher than for females (−0.010). Overall, body condition declined annually (−0.014 per year; 95% CI: −0.025 – −0.004), and there was an additive annual decline in body condition of seal pups across all species and sexes (−0.020; 95% CI: −0.030 – −0.011). An additive annual increase in body condition of spotted seals across all sexes and age classes (0.013; 95% CI: 0.004–0.022) mitigated the annual declines for this species. Model-averaged fitted values therefore indicated annual declines in body condition for ribbon and harbor seals of all sex and age classes, and for spotted seal pups. We relate these declines to the trend in Bering Sea ice extent and to recent, rapid changes brought on by the significant Northeast Pacific marine heat wave of 2014–2016 and its lingering effects through 2018 and 2019. The results indicate that these typically resilient, long-lived, generalist predators can be impacted by bottom-up forcing.},

  abstract = {The Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus, AUFS) population is still recovering from the over-exploitation of the commercial-sealing era (18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries). While the population is considered to be only < 47% of its pre-harvest size, it now represents the greatest resident marine predator biomass in the south-eastern Australian marine ecosystem. The region is experiencing rapid environmental change and, as a keystone predator species, the AUFS is an indicator of ecosystem health. In the present study, the body mass, standard length and body condition index (BCI) were analysed between 1997-2021 in adult female AUFS provisioning pups on Kanowna Island (northern Bass Strait), the third largest colony for the species. While substantial inter-annual fluctuations were observed, there was no temporal trend in standard length during the 23-year study period. In contrast, body mass and, consequently, BCI decreased significantly, suggesting the population is experiencing changing nutritional conditions. While these changes do not appear to be due to competition with commercial fisheries or population expansion, weak but significant negative relationships were observed between BCI and 1-year lagged sea surface temperature and summer zonal winds in the Bonney Upwelling region, and both current- and 2-year lagged Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). These findings suggest the BCI of AUFS may continue to decline under predicted climate change conditions. While a lack of a concurrent decline in pup production could indicate a degree of nutritional tolerance or flexibility in energy allocation, further monitoring is required to assess decreases in reproductive parameters (e.g., birth mass, pre-weaning growth rates) or vital rates, which would be expected with continued nutritional stress.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: Pinnipeds have marked seasonal changes in body condition, accumulating energy reserves prior to the reproduction period, and depleting these reserves during the breeding and molting periods. This cycle is not well described in male harp seals
\textit{Phoca groenlandica}. We obtained morphometric measurements for 3167 Northwest Atlantic male harp seals sampled between 1979 and 1995. The part of the yearly cycle covered in this study (November to May) was divided into short blocks around median
dates called periods¹. For each period, a growth curve was calculated for body mass, sculp mass, core mass and standard length. These sequential growth curves were used to calculate changes in size-at-age between periods. In addition, seasonal changes in
3 condition indices (general, sculp and core condition), in blubber thickness and in the ratio of sculp to total mass were analyzed using locally weighted regressions. Male harp seals returned from their high-latitude feeding grounds heavier, in better
condition, and with a thicker blubber layer than when they left the area in the spring. However, maxima in length, mass, condition and blubber thickness were not observed until the February 22 period (February 12 to March 4), or in the case of seals
younger than 5 yr, sometime in March. Mass losses associated with the rut began between the periods February 22 and March 15 (March 5 to 25) and were most pronounced in seals older than 10 yr. About 66\% of the losses in mass came from the core during this
period. We estimated that males lost 39.4 kg during the rut (1.16 kg d$^{\textrm{-1}}$ or 0.78\% of initial mass d$^{\textrm{-1}}$, 44\% from sculp and 56\% from core) and incurred energy expenditures of 840 MJ (24.7 MJ d$^{\textrm{-1}}$). This corresponds to twice
the standard metabolic rate (SMR), and suggests that males are feeding during the rut. All males lost mass in April, and again in May. They began to molt April 19 period (April 16 to 22). Fewer than half the seals had completed the shedding of old hair
when the study ended, in the May 10 period. Rates of mass loss during the molt varied from 1 to 1.8 kg d$^{\textrm{-1}}$, depending on the age of the seals. Minima of length, mass, condition and blubber thickness were observed in May. Molting appears to be a
period of high energy expenditures (3 to 5 SMR) despite the low levels of activity observed at this time. This study revealed that length also changes seasonally: fat seals in February were longer than lean seals of the same age in late April.},
